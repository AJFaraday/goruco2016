<h3 id="nycs-regional-ruby-conference-goruco-returns-this-june-25th-for-its-10-year-anniversary">NYC’s regional Ruby conference GORUCO returns this June 25th for its 10 year anniversary!</h3>

<p>The Gotham Ruby Conference, a one-day, single-track event in New York City, is now accepting talk proposals. <a href="http://goruco.com/">GORUCO</a> will be held on Saturday, June 25th, 2016 in the Altman building in the Flatiron District of Manhattan.</p>

<h3 id="topics-if-youre-interested-were-interested">Topics: If You’re Interested, We’re Interested</h3>

<p>We’re interested in talks on Ruby, but as the NYC Ruby community has grown and matured, our mission has expanded to include anything of interest to the modern development community.</p>

<p>Accepted topics from last year included Building and testing resilient applications, Home Automation with the Amazon Echo and Ruby, Great Caching Disasters, Un-Artificial Intelligence, Rails 5, Turbolinks 3, Event sourcing, and even Sweaters as a service. We’d love to see proposals on Golang, Elixir, DevOps, Docker, or whatever else is exciting you as a maker lately.</p>

<h3 id="talk-formats-and-constraints">Talk Formats and Constraints</h3>

<p>This year we will again be accepting two talk formats:</p>

<ul>
<li>30 minute full-length talk (plus Q&amp;A)</li>
<li>10 minute micro-talk.</li>
</ul>

<p>All speakers will receive free attendance to the event. In addition those speakers selected for a full-length talk will receive:</p>

<ul>
<li>A $300 honorarium for local speakers.</li>
<li>A $900 travel reimbursement if you live outside of the tri-state region.</li>
</ul>

<p>All proposals must specify exactly who will be presenting. For example, we will not accept proposals from companies unless they specify who will be presenting on behalf of the company. Presentations may be given by more than one person, but multiple speakers will split the honorarium and travel reimbursement.</p>

<h3 id="local-speaker-slots">Local Speaker Slots</h3>

<p>GORUCO believes in highlighting local talent. We reserve at least two slots for local speakers. Individual talks and panels will be considered local if at least half of the participants are from the tri-state region - that is, within typical commuting distance of Manhattan. In the past, these slots have been less competitive than the other talk slots, so if you live in the tri-state region we strongly urge you to submit a proposal.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-submit">How to Submit</h3>

<p>Please submit as many proposals as you’d like through this form:</p>

<p><a href="http://cfp.goruco.com/events/2016">CFP 2016</a></p>

<p>Once the CFP is closed, we’ll let everyone know if they’ve been accepted or not.</p>

<h3 id="video-archives">Video Archives</h3>

<p>We will be recording all the talks and making the videos freely available online. If your talk is accepted, you’ll be asked to sign a consent form.</p>

<h3 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h3>

<p>In order to ensure that GORUCO is a welcoming and safe conference, all attendees and speakers are expected to abide by our <a href="http://goruco.com/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>. Please make sure that your talk proposal and materials respect this.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please email info@goruco.com.</p>

<p>Please submit all proposals by 11:59:59 PM EDT on Friday, April 1st, 2016.</p>
